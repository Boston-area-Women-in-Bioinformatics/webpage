Ready to level up your GitHub skills? GitHub Basics 2 builds on the foundations from our first session and dives deeper into collaborative coding skills like:

- Branching and pull requests
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Using issues and discussions to communicate code changes

This is a hands-on, beginner-friendly workshop designed to help you gain confidence with GitHub workflows, whether youâ€™re contributing to open source, managing your own projects, or collaborating with a team. A basic understanding of making commits and working with remotes is required. If you didn't attend our first GitHub basics workshop, please review the material for making commits [here](https://github.com/sstein93/git-github-workshop/blob/main/02_git_basics.md) and working with remotes [here](https://github.com/sstein93/git-github-workshop/blob/main/03_git_github.md).

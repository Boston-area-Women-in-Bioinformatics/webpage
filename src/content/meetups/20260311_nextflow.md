## What is the NF-Core Hackathon?

nf-core is a community effort to collect a curated set of tools, modules, and pipelines built using Nextflow. Whether you're already involved in nf-core or not, this hackathon is the perfect place to get to know other members of the community in person. You'll collaborate on projects, discuss code, and learn from each other.

To get a feel for how the event works, check out the similar-style hackathons held in [2024](https://nf-co.re/events/2024/hackathon-march-2024) and [2025](https://nf-co.re/events/2025/hackathon-march-2025).

## How It Works

The nf-core hackathons are not competitive — they're collaborative, community-driven events where participants work together on projects. Projects can be anything from adding new features to existing pipelines to creating entirely new ones. You can bring your own topic or choose from a list of open issues in the community. We group people based on the types of tasks being tackled, so you can work with others who have similar interests.

# Who Should Attend?

All are welcome — no prior nf-core contributions needed. Newcomers to nf-core are encouraged to join, but some experience writing Nextflow code is expected. This is a hackathon, not a training workshop.

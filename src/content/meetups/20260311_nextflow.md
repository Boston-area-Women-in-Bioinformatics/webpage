Join nextflow enthusiasts in person or online **March 11-13, 2026**, for the nf-core hackathon! More details are coming soon, but to get a feel for how the event will work, check out the similar style hackathons that were held in [2024](https://nf-co.re/events/2024/hackathon-march-2024) and [2025](https://nf-co.re/events/2025/hackathon-march-2025).

## What is the NF-Core Hackathon?

nf-core is a community effort to collect a curated set of tools, modules and pipelines built using Nextflow.

Whether you're already involved in nf-core or not, this hackathon is the perfect place to get to know other members of the community in person. You'll collaborate on projects, discuss code and learn from each other.

Audience: All welcome, no prior nf-core contributions needed.

Required: Some experience with writing Nextflow code.

Beginners are welcome: Please note that this is not a training event.

## How It Works

The nf-core hackathons are not competitive. Instead, they are collaborative, community-driven events where participants work together on projects. Projects can be anything from adding new features to existing pipelines, to creating entirely new pipelines.

You can bring your own favourite topic or choose from a list of open issues in the community. We try to group people based on the types of tasks that are being tackled, so that you can work with others who have similar interests.

Curious about making the leap into independent consulting? Don't miss this **Ask Me Anything (AMA)** session with the co-founders of **Sprout Informatics**, a newly formed data science consultancy.

​Just two months ago, two biotech industry veterans transitioned from leading Data Science teams to launching our own venture, armed only with an idea of what we loved to do--everything else was very much "build the plane as you fly it" in typical biotech fashion.

​Join [Liyang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liyang-diao-90933461/) and [Mike](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelwseiler/), co-founders of [Sprout Informatics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprout-informatics/), in the early stages of our journey into entrepreneurship to chat about what it takes to start a specialized data science / bioinformatics consultancy.

**​Come on, ask us anything (answers not guaranteed)!**

​Ever wondered about the following?

- **​Startup Secrets**: The initial legal, financial, and logistical steps.

- **​Finding Clients**: Strategies for your first contract and setting your rates.

​\* **The Transition**: Managing the shift from employee to business owner.

​This event is co-hosted by Boston-Area Women in Bioinformatics (BWIB), [Sprout Informatics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprout-informatics/), and the [Cambridge Biotech Club](https://www.cambridgebiotechclub.com/).

**Curious about making the leap into independent consulting?**

Don't miss this Ask Me Anything (AMA) session with [Liyang Diao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liyang-diao-90933461/) and [Michael Seiler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelwseiler/), two industry veterans and the co-founders of Sprout Informatics, a newly launched consultancy specializing in data science and bioinformatics.

Two months ago, Liyang and Mike transitioned from leading data science teams in the biotech sector to founding their own venture. With a clear vision but no predefined roadmap, their journey has been a dynamic exercise in entrepreneurship. True to biotech form, they’ve been “building the plane as they fly it.”

This AMA offers a candid look at the early stages of launching a specialized consultancy. Liyang and Mike will share insights from their transition, lessons learned, and the realities of starting a business in a niche technical field.

**​Come on, ask us anything (answers not guaranteed, but honesty is)!**

### Event Topics:

- **​Startup Logistics**: The initial legal, financial, and operational steps.

- **Client Acquisition**: Strategies for landing your first contract and setting your rates.

- **Career Transitions**: Navigating the shift from employee to business owner.

- **​Market Niche**: Identifying and serving a high-value need in the biotech space.

​Whether you're a student planning a future career path or a seasoned professional considering a change, this is an opportunity to connect, learn, and have a frank discussion about independent consulting in bioinformatics.

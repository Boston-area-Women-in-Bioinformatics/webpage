Please join Shayna for a hands-on R workshop focused on writing your own R packages!

​This is a great opportunity to learn how to write shareable, reusable, reproducible and version controlled R code.

​She will cover the basics of using devtools and roxygen in a step by step training with live coding exercises.

​Space is limited—reserve your spot today ONLY IF you are sure to attend!

​Parking available at Windsor Pl, Somerville, MA 02143.

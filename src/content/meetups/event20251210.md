This event is co-hosted by [Boston-Area Women in Bioinformatics (BWIB)](https://boston-wib.org) and [Felsted Coaching & Consulting](https://www.felstedcoaching.com).

Your career is your most personal experiment, requiring both strategic thinking and adaptive flexibility. Linear career trajectories are giving way to "squiggly" paths that demand updated approaches to advancement in today’s evolving scientific landscape. This session will equip you with a framework to navigate career advancement with intention.
Dr. Jenn Felsted-Knight, former neuroscientist turned leadership coach, will introduce her signature ADAPT framework designed to help you clarify your goals and unique value proposition, create a roadmap that evolves with changing priorities, and apply systematic approaches to career decision-making. We'll explore key factors including building visibility for your work, developing strategic relationships, and creating sustainable advancement strategies that integrate with your life priorities.

Following the framework presentation, the session will include dedicated time for your questions, creating space to apply the framework to your specific career challenges and learn from each other's experiences.

Join us on August 12th

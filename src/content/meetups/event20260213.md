If you're taking the MBTA Green Line, hop off at Lechmere Station—it’s just a short walk to the mall entrance. Driving in? The mall offers plenty of garage parking with flexible hourly rates and extended hours, so you’ll have no trouble finding a spot.

​Once inside, head toward Chilacates—we’ll be nearby! The food court features a variety of [dining options](https://www.cambridgeside.com/event/canalside-food-drink/2145582916), so feel free to grab a bite, explore, and settle in.

Do you want to expand your network in the Greater Boston area? Are you looking for advice with career transitions, growth in your role, how to get up the next rung of the ladder? Do you want to share your accumulated wisdom and give back to the community?

Boston-area Women in Bioinformatics is launching virtual peer-to-peer and mentor-to-peer network to tackle all these and other concerns! We are looking for a group of 30 people to help us pilot the network ahead of a wider launch. If you are interested in expanding your network and helping us test drive our tool, sign up and join us!

Venue, food, and drinks are generously provided by our sponsor, Watershed Bio.

**Note: Bioinformatics Sisters is only open to people identifying as women.**

Come join us for an introductory GitHub workshop! We will walk through the basics on creating a Git repository, committing and tracking changes, and syncing local and remote versions of your work.

This will be in person only, but we will share the materials on the BAWIB slack channel after the event for those who are interested but canâ€™t attend.

The event location is in Cambridge, MA, and we'll share it with attendees closer to the date.

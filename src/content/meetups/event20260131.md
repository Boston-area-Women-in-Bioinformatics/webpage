**Speaker**: [Hannah Haeun Hwangbo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haeun-hannah-hwangbo/)

Get ready to see coding in a whole new light! Hannah is diving into how AI tools are reshaping the way we work — not just making things faster, but fundamentally changing our workflows, debugging approaches, and problem-solving strategies. Whether you're already using AI copilots or curious about what all the fuss is about, this session will show you real examples of how these tools are transforming daily development work.

We'll explore the practical shifts happening right now: what tasks are becoming obsolete, which new skills matter, and how to adapt your coding habits to work with (not against) AI assistants. Bring your questions, your skepticism, or your stories about that time GitHub Copilot suggested something wonderfully weird!

This event is co-hosted by Boston Women in Bioinformatics and Bioinformatics Xchange Club (BXC).

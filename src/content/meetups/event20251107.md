Are you a bioinformatics enthusiast looking to meet and mingle with fellow professionals in a relaxed and unscripted environment? Join us for a Bioinformatics Networking Lunch, an informal gathering where great conversations, shared ideas, and new connections are on the menu!

We'll be meeting at the Cambridgeside food court â€” look for us near Chilacates! The venue offers a variety of dining options, so feel free to explore what's available here.

Note: This event is only open to people identifying as women.

**Please understand that each guest will be paying for a meal and/or beverages of their choice.**

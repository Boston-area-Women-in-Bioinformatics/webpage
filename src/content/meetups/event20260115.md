Are you a bioinformatics enthusiast looking to meet and mingle with fellow professionals in a relaxed and unscripted environment? Join us for a relaxed, no-pressure social event designed for one thing: connecting with other women in bioinformatics. There's no formal program or presentations—just an opportunity to have real conversations, expand your network, and meet the people who make up Boston's vibrant bioinformatics community.

We'll have exclusive 10-year anniversary swag available for anyone who missed our recent celebration. We're also working on arranging professional headshots with a photographer, perfect timing for refreshing your LinkedIn profile or website. More details on photo sessions coming soon!

​Whether you're looking to make new professional connections, reconnect with colleagues, or simply spend an evening with ladies who understand what "debugging a Nextflow pipeline" means, we'd love to see you there. Since the bar is located in a food court, feel free to grab dinner or snacks—you're not limited to just drinks!

​Come as you are. Stay as long as you'd like (until 9pm when the mall closes). Leave with new connections.

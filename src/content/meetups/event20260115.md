Are you a bioinformatics enthusiast looking to kick off the new year by meeting and mingling with fellow professionals in a relaxed and unscripted environment? Join us for a relaxed, no-pressure social event designed for one thing: connecting with others in the bioinformatics community. There's no formal program or presentations—just an opportunity to have real conversations, expand your network, and meet the people who make up Boston's vibrant bioinformatics community.

While this event focuses on supporting women and gender-diverse individuals in bioinformatics, allies are welcome to join us. If you're attending as an ally, please review our [ally guidelines](#ally) below to help make this the supportive, inclusive space we're building together.

As we step into 2026, we want to hear your vision for the year ahead! Come ready to share ideas for events you'd like to see, community initiatives you'd like to contribute to, or tools and resources you wish existed in the bioinformatics space. Let's start the new year by building new connections and shaping what our community does next.

## How to find us:

We’ll be gathering at the [C-Side Bar](https://www.csidebar.com/) in the [CambridgeSide Mall food court](https://www.cambridgeside.com/canalside), a lively and accessible spot right in the heart of East Cambridge. If you're taking the MBTA Green Line, hop off at Lechmere Station—it’s just a short walk to the mall entrance. Driving in? The mall offers plenty of garage parking with flexible hourly rates and extended hours, so you’ll have no trouble finding a spot.

The food court features a variety of [dining options](https://www.cambridgeside.com/event/canalside-food-drink/2145582916), so feel free to grab a bite, a beverage, and stay awhile!

### <a name="ally"></a> Guidelines for Allies

We welcome allies to join us in supporting women in bioinformatics! Your presence helps build a more inclusive community. Most of this is probably obvious to you, but it's easy to fall into old habits in professional settings, so here's a friendly reminder of how to be most supportive:

**How to be an ally**:

This is primarily a space for women to connect, share experiences, and support each other. As an ally, focus on listening and learning rather than being the center of attention. Contribute thoughtfully to conversations, but leave plenty of space for women's voices - aim to listen more than you speak.

**​How to contribute positively**:

- Invite women colleagues who would benefit from this community - arriving together can make it easier for newcomers to join in, and you'll help us grow the network.

- Ask thoughtful questions rather than offering unsolicited advice or explanations

- ​If someone shares their expertise or experience, trust it - avoid the urge to explain or debate

- ​When women share experiences of bias or challenges, listen and validate rather than offering alternative explanations

- ​Help make introductions between people with shared professional interests

- ​If you notice someone standing alone or between conversations, invite them to join yours: "We're talking about [topic], would you like to join us?"

**​What to avoid:**

- ​Interrupting women who are speaking

- ​Taking up speaking opportunities or networking slots meant for women attendees

- ​Lengthy monologues or centering your own perspectives in discussions about gender equity

We were a BUSY booth at the Cambridge Science Carnival 2025! Lots of curious minds stopped by for learning about DNA and Bioinformatics with questions and our popular DNA bracelet activity! What a perfect day to be outside and surrounded by all-things-Science! It was an incredible day of outreach, and we couldnâ€™t have done it without this amazing community. Thank you again to everyone who stopped by, volunteered, or supported us in making STEM accessible and exciting for the next generation!

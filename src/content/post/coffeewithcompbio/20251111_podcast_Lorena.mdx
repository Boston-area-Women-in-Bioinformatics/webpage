What really happens when a wet lab scientist and a computational biologist sit down to plan an experiment? Spoiler: it's not always smooth sailing. In this episode of 'A Coffee with Compbio,' Lorena Pantano and Alex Bartlett chat with Amulya about the real talk nobody tells you about scientific collaborations.

They break down the three make-or-break moments of any project: that first meeting where you're figuring out if single-cell sequencing on mouse eyes is actually the move (hint: maybe start simpler), the data processing stage where quality issues rear their ugly head, and those uncomfortable conversations when results don't pan out.

What you'll learn:

- How to redirect overambitious project plans without shutting people down
- Smart ways to communicate technology limitations early
- What to say when pilot data quality is... not great
- Why being adaptable beats being rigid every single time

If you want to level up your collaboration game and avoid common pitfalls, grab your coffee and tune in.

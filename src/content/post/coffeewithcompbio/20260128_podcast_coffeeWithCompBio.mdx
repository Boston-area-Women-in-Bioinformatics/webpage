Grab your coffee and join us for another episode of **A Coffee with Comp Bio**!

New year, new episode, new comp-bio goals and new hosts. But first, we wish you a very Happy New Year! Most new year's resolutions fail due to lack of clarity, so to make it easier, we begin our first episode of the season with a list that hopefully inspires you. From using AI tools to make your life easier to documenting your own code better, we are bringing resolutions every computational biologist needs this new year. Tune into the latest episode of “A Coffee with CompBio” where Sharvari Narendra and Saba Nafees present 12 awesome resolutions for the new year.

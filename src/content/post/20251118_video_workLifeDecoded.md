**Your manager isn’t your boss. They’re your business partner.**

Most people see their manager as someone who assigns tasks and approves time off. But here's what changes everything: your manager is fighting for budget in meetings you'll never attend, juggling competing priorities from other departments, and trying to figure out who gets that one promotion slot when three people want it.

Once you understand their world, you can position yourself strategically.

Instead of: "I finished the project" Try: "I finished the project two days early, which means we can move the client presentation up if needed, and I documented the process for the team"

You're giving them options and solutions, not just updates.

**The strategic question most people never ask:** "What does success look like for YOU this quarter?"

Not the team – for them personally. Maybe they're trying to improve retention, hit a revenue target, or launch something new. Once you know their goals, you can align your work to support them.

This isn't about sucking up. It's about understanding that your manager has the authority to open doors for you – but they can't read your mind, and they're dealing with constraints you might not see.

Watch the full video where Lorena and I break down:

- Understanding the hidden pressures your manager faces
- Communication strategies that actually work
- How to build trust and advocate for yourself strategically

**Thanksgiving in Biotech: A Survival Guide**

Explaining what you do at Thanksgiving dinner is excellent training for cross-functional communication.

If you can make your uncle understand what a "data pipeline" is without his eyes glazing over, you can definitely explain it to the finance team.

This year I'm grateful for:

- Scientists who actually read error messages
- Pipelines that DON'T fail at 4:55pm on Friday
- The person who invented the mute button for family Zoom calls

Happy Thanksgiving to everyone who's explained bioinformatics to their relatives today. You're all bridges between worlds. 🦃

What's your "explaining your job to family" survival strategy?

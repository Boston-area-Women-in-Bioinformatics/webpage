In their latest video, Women in Bioinformatics chairs Lorena and Lina tackle a deceptively simple practice that can transform your career: keeping a weekly log of your wins and quantifying your achievements.

This isn't just about surviving performance review season—though it absolutely makes that easier. A weekly win log is your defense against imposter syndrome, your foundation for a compelling resume, and your ammunition when it's time to negotiate for what you deserve. The commitment? Just five minutes every Friday.

The video walks through why this habit matters, what to track, and how to quantify your impact with concrete before/after examples. No more scrambling six months later trying to remember what you accomplished. No more underselling yourself because you forgot the numbers that prove your value.

Lorena and Lina created a one-page Quick Reference Guide with practical setup tips and real examples—available exclusively to Patreon supporters along with the full video.
Ready to build this career-changing habit? Watch [Your Weekly Win Log – The Career Tool You Didn't Know You Needed](https://www.patreon.com/posts/your-weekly-win-142523683) on Patreon and start logging this Friday. Set that 5-minute calendar reminder right now—your future self will thank you.

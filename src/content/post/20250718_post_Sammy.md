  title: "The Genomics Diversity Crisis: Why DEI Isn't Just About Workplace Culture"

As diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)  initiatives are being dismantled across US institutions, Eric Green, former Director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, opened the Festival of Genomics in Boston to make a case that DEI initiatives extend far beyond creating better workplace culture. In genomics research, DEI is not just the right thing to do, it's scientifically essential. Current scientific datasets overwhelmingly represent people of European ancestry, yet the genetic insights we derive from this narrow slice of humanity are being applied to diagnose, treat, and understand disease across all populations. DEI initiatives provide a pathway to ensure scientific advances benefit everyone.

### The Technical Problem: Model Overfitting

Overfitting is a fundamental challenge at the heart of genomics research. This occurs when a model becomes so specialized to its training data that it struggles to perform well when applied to new, different datasets. It's like a student who memorizes specific answers to a test but can't apply the underlying concepts to different problems. Rather than capture meaningful patterns, these models are shaped by noise in their training set, producing unreliable or misleading outputs.

In the field of genomics, the risk of overfitting takes on particular urgency. In 2021, an estimated 86% of sequenced genomic data came from individuals of European ancestry [^1]. This staggering imbalance means that models trained on this data are systematically biased and, therefore, unreliable across diverse populations. This is a profound problem because models that fail to generalize to marginalized communities will inevitably exacerbate existing health disparities.

As bioinformatics enters a new era of artificial intelligence (AI) driven discovery, the composition of our training data has never mattered more. How can we build a future of personalized medicine on a foundation that only represents less than 20% of the world's population?

### The Human Problem: A Legacy of Distrust

To improve our biological models, we must prioritize diverse dataset collection. However, while the solution seems straightforward, the reality is far more complex. The scientific community's painful history of human exploitation and data misuse continues to stifle many communities' willingness to participate in research studies.

These scars run deep. From 1932 to 1972, with support from state and local governments, the US Public Health Service conducted what became known as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, misleading impoverished Black male sharecroppers to participate in a treatment program for their "bad blood" [^2]. In reality, the program was a study of the progression of untreated syphilis. Withheld from diagnoses and available treatment, hundreds of participants lost their lives from the disease in the name of scientific advancement.

Even well-intentioned research can have ethical missteps that deepen distrust. In the 1990s, as the rate of diabetes climbed in the Havasupai tribe, an indigenous community near the Grand Canyon, around 650 members donated blood samples to Arizona State University to study genetic links to diabetes [^3]. Approximately a hundred participants signed a consent form allowing their samples to be used to "study the causes of behavior/medical disorders." However, with English as a second language for many participants and most having never completed high school, the full implications of this broad consent were at high risk of not being understood. Therefore, when researchers used the tribe's samples in studies unrelated to diabetes, it was done with with disregard to the civil rights of the Havasupai tribe to self-determination. Rightfully, the Havasupai tribe sued the university and has refused to participate in any further studies.

More recently, the rise of consumer genetic testing, such as those offered by 23andMe and AncestryDNA, make it easy to share genetic data. However, these platforms have also caused increased concerns about data transparency for marginalized communities. These companies tell consumers that consumers own their personal data. However, data from these companies is often sold to third parties, including pharmaceutical companies and law enforcement.  For communities who are already wary of government surveillance and overpolicing, the knowledge that their genetic information could potentially be used to either develop drugs and medicines that they will not have access to or carry out a wrongful conviction for them or a family member adds another layer of hesitation to research participation. 

The examples listed only touch the surface of these deeply rooted issues that plague distrust of the scientific community, and I encourage readers to learn more outside the context of this article.

### A Path Forward: DEI as a Framework for Rebuilding Trust

History shows that trust in science, even after profound breaches, can be rebuilt. The atrocities conducted by medical professionals in the Holocaust ruptured the relationship between science and Jewish communities. Despite this history, today the Ashkenazi Jewish population is among the most studied groups in human genetics. This transformation did not happen overnight, but rather through decades of ethical reform, public accountability, and intentional efforts to earn back trust.

Part of this effort is reflected in the Nuremberg Code, a framework for protecting human subjects in research with a strong emphasis on informed consent that was directly influenced by the experiences of Jewish victims of Nazi medical experiments [^4]. The foundation for modern research ethics, the Nuremberg Code's emphasis on informed consent, participant autonomy, and societal benefit embodies the definition of equity. 

The historical precedent set by the Nuremberg Code shows us the way forward. However, it must be acknowledged that the ethical standards brought forth by the Nuremberg Code have not been consistently applied across all communities in research contexts. Ethical violations persist, and mistrust remains deeply rooted globally. While the Nuremberg Code establishes ethical principles aimed at equity in research, it does not explicitly address the importance of diversity and inclusion. During World War II, organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation's Refugee Scholar Program worked to resettle Jewish scientists, supporting their continued involvement in research despite widespread persecution [^5]. Emerging evidence shows that when research teams reflect the diversity of the populations they are studying, they are more likely to pursue questions that align with community needs and interpret data through culturally-informed frameworks. This approach is associated with fostering environments where participants feel understood and respected. Along with the establishment of the Nuremberg Code, the refugee aid that supported Jewish scholars likely contributed significantly to the community’s ability to rebuild trust in scientific authority after the war.

This historical example demonstrates how institutional inclusion complemented by ethical frameworks rebuild trust. Today, we see similar patterns emerging in other contexts through DEI initiatives. The inclusion of researchers from communities affected by HIV/AIDS has been associated with improved rates of community engagement in research and better treatment outcomes [^6]. Similarly, Indigenous health research programs indicate that studies of their communities benefit from Indigenous leadership by increasing community engagement and fostering resources to support non-Indigenous research team members to develop cultural competency [^7]. These DEI initiatives work to ensure that voices of these communities were empowered to shape the research process, from study design to data interpretation.

It must be emphasized that the ideals of DEI are not quick fixes, they are sustained, proactive commitments to ensure diversity through informed consent and inclusion. As genomics continues to evolve, so must our standards for how research is conducted, whose data is included, and how the data is used. By building trust, we build better science and, in turn, better health outcomes for everyone.

As we stand at the threshold of AI-driven genomics, we have a choice to make. We can continue building models on a narrow foundation that serves only a fraction of humanity, or we can invest in the trust-building work necessary to create truly inclusive research. The technical quality of our science depends on our decision.

  title: "The Genomics Diversity Crisis: Why DEI Isn't Just About Workplace Culture"

When Eric Green, former Director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, opened the Festival of Genomics in Boston last month, he made a case that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives extend far beyond creating better workplace culture. In genomics research, DEI is not just the right thing to do, it's scientifically essential.

### The Technical Problem: Model Overfitting

Overfitting is a fundamental challenge at the heart of genomics research. This occurs when a model becomes so tailored to its training data that it struggles to perform well on data that is different from the training data. Rather than capture meaningful patterns, these models are shaped by noise in their training set, producing unreliable or misleading outputs.

In the field of genomics, the risk of overfitting takes on particular urgency. In 2021, an estimated 86% of sequenced genomic data came from individuals of European ancestry [^1]. This staggering imbalance means that models trained on this data are systematically biased and, therefore, unreliable across diverse populations. This is a profound problem because models that fail to generalize to marginalized communities will inevitably exacerbate existing health disparities.

As bioinformatics enters a new era of artificial intelligence (AI) driven discovery, the composition of our training data has never mattered more. How can we build a future of personalized medicine on a foundation that only represents less than 20% of the world's population?

### The Human Problem: A Legacy of Distrust

To improve our biological models, we must prioritize diverse dataset collection. However, while the solution seems straightforward, the reality is far more complex. The scientific community's painful history of exploitation continues to stifle many communities' willingness to participate in research studies.

These scars run deep. From 1932 to 1972, with support from state and local governments, the US Public Health Service conducted what became known as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, misleading impoverished Black male sharecroppers to participate in a treatment program for their "bad blood" [^2]. In reality, the program was a study of the progression of untreated syphilis. Withheld from diagnoses and available treatment, hundreds of participants lost their lives from the disease in the name of scientific advancement.

Even well-intentioned research has the ability to go awry. In the 1990s, as the rate of diabetes climbed in the Havasupai tribe, an indigenous community near the Grand Canyon, around 650 members donated blood samples to Arizona State University to study genetic links to diabetes [^3]. Approximately a hundred participants signed a consent form allowing their samples to be used to "study the causes of behavior/medical disorders." However, with English as a second language for many participants and most having never completed high school, the full implications of this broad consent were at high risk of not being understood. Therefore, when unrelated studies used the blood samples, it violated the civil rights of the Havasupai tribe. The Havasupai tribe sued the university and has refused to participate in any further studies.

### A Path Forward: DEI as a Framework for Rebuilding Trust

History shows that trust in science, even after profound breaches, can be rebuilt. The atrocities conducted by medical professionals in the Holocaust ruptured the relationship between science and Jewish communities. Despite this history, today the Ashkenazi Jewish population is among the most studied groups in human genetics. This transformation did not happen overnight, but rather through decades of ethical reform, public accountability, and intentional efforts to earn back trust.

Part of this effort is reflected in the Nuremberg Code, a framework for protecting human subjects in research with a strong emphasis on informed consent that was directly influenced by the experiences of Jewish victims of Nazi medical experiments [^4]. The foundation for modern research ethics, the Nuremberg Code's emphasis on informed consent, participant autonomy, and societal benefit embodies many of the values now championed under DEI. In this light, the Nuremberg Code can be seen not just as a legal framework, but as an early prototype for inclusive and equitable science.

The historical precedent set by the Nuremberg Code shows us the way forward. However, it must be acknowledged that the ethical standards established by the Nuremberg Code have not been consistently applied across all communities in research contexts. Ethical violations persist, and mistrust remains deeply rooted globally. This is because DEI is not a quick fix, it's a sustained, proactive commitment. As genomics continues to evolve, so must our standards for how research is conducted and whose data is included. By building trust, we build better science and, in turn, better health outcomes for everyone.

As we stand at the threshold of AI-driven genomics, we have a choice to make as a community. We can continue building models on a narrow foundation that serves only a fraction of humanity, or we can invest in the trust-building work necessary to create truly inclusive research. The technical quality of our science depends on our decision.

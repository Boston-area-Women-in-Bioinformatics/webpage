Grab your coffee and join us for another episode of **A Coffee with Comp Bio**!

This time, Alexandra Bartlett and I kick things off with Amulya Shastry, a PhD student at Boston University and co-chair of Boston Women in Bioinformatics, who introduces us to **llmr -- a new Tidyverse-friendly** tool for connecting with LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, and more.

Then we sit down with Lina L. Faller, Ph.D., a veteran in bioinformatics with nearly two decades of experience bridging software engineering, research, and pharma. Lina shares **why she started blogging about sustainable data systems, leadership in tech, and the very human side of computational biology**. We dive into one of her favorite topics: **why computational biologists should keep lab notebooks** (yes, even if your "lab" is just a laptop). From reproducibility to institutional memory to the art of "**forensic bioinformatics**," Lina brings stories and advice that will be useful to anyone working with data.

If you’ve ever forgotten what you coded six months ago (we’ve all been there), or wondered how AI might fit into documentation and knowledge-sharing, this episode is for you.

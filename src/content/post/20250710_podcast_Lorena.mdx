In this episode, we journey through the real-life challenges of building interactive single cell spatial data visualizations for large projects. Lorena shares her recent adventure turning mountains of data into a web app using tools like Python, R, and the (tricky-to-pronounce) single-cell viewer [_Vitessce_](https://vitessce.io/). She discusses the hurdles of image cropping, memory limits, Python-R crossovers, and why “just putting it online” isn’t as easy as it sounds—especially when it comes to privacy, deployment, and avoiding surprise cloud bills. If you’ve ever had a collaborator say, "Can you just build me an app I can play with?", this episode is for you.

In the "**Quick Sip**" segment, Alex and Lorena share tips on automating code linting with GitHub Actions. Finally, in our "**Brewing Up Answers**" segment, we chat about managing people in academia vs. industry, and why it’s a very different ballgame on each side of the fence.

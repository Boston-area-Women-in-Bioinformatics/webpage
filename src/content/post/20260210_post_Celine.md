  title: 'ctDNA as a Clinical Endpoint'
  description: 'Takeaways from the FoCR Symposium'
---

I recently attended the virtual **[Friends of Cancer Research](https://www.linkedin.com/company/friends-of-cancer-research/) (FoCR)** symposium on **Modernizing Oncology Endpoints**, focused on **circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)** and **AI-enabled imaging**. The discussion brought together FoCR, industry, FDA, and academia, and it was energizing to see the progress so far, plus a clear path forward.

## Key takeaways

**The ctMoniTR Project showed ctDNA’s clinical signal at scale and what’s needed next.**

With 20+ sponsors pooling heterogeneous trial datasets, ctMoniTR found consistent patient-level links between ctDNA reduction/clearance and patient outcomes. The next challenge is turning these signals into trial-ready and regulator-ready endpoints, especially in early-stage MRD where ctDNA levels are lowest.

**Tissue availability is becoming a limiting factor.**

Tumor-informed MRD assays are often preferred, but tissue is not always accessible or usable. A practical approach is to design dual-assay strategy up front: tumor-informed when feasible, with a tumor-naive backup, plus clear decision rules and an analysis plan that handles both.

**Scaling requires prospective standardization.**.

Define clinical landmark timepoints and sampling schedules in advance, not retroactively. Real-world data can help fill natural history gaps (lead time, kinetics), but only with careful tracking of assay versions and the treatment time period.

## Looking Ahead

As ctDNA endpoints evolve, they can enable **earlier interventions** by detecting molecular change sooner and supporting faster decisions in both **clinical trials** and **patient care**. Teams that prioritize **harmonization up** front will be best positioned to move quickly and confidently.

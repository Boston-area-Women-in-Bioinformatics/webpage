“That person is SO incompetent.” “This project is a disaster.” “Management has no idea what they’re doing.”

We’ve all worked with chronic complainers. And if you’re in any kind of leadership role—formal or informal—you’ve probably felt the pressure to fix everyone’s frustrations.

Here’s what I wish someone had told me 10 years ago: You’re not the office therapist.

In the latest episode of "Work Life Decoded", Lorena and Lina break down practical strategies for handling workplace negativity without getting dragged into the drama or becoming everyone’s emotional dumping ground.

You’ll learn:

- The 3-step framework for redirecting chronic complainers toward action
- How to separate legitimate work issues from gossip and personal drama
- The exact language to transform negative conversations in real-time
- Boundary-setting strategies that protect your own mental space

This isn’t about toxic positivity or pretending problems don’t exist. It’s about knowing when negativity is productive and when it’s destructive—and having the tools to navigate both.

Because negativity is contagious. But so is the solution-focused energy you bring to your team.

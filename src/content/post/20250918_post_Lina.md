In biotech, the pressure to deliver results "by Friday's meeting" often creates shortcuts that become permanent infrastructure. I've seen analysis scripts become production pipelines, temporary databases become data warehouses, and proof-of-concept tools become mission-critical systems.

But here's the hidden cost: each quick fix makes the system harder to teach. The more convoluted a project becomes, the more it creates knowledge silos. Suddenly, one person becomes the "go-to" for maintaining that tool, and it becomes incomprehensible to everyone else.

This isn't just technical debt—it's 𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗲𝗯𝘁. You've accidentally created a single point of failure disguised as expertise.

The challenge isn't eliminating quick fixes—it's being intentional about which ones you keep and how you document the journey.

- Document the shortcuts you take (and why)

- Schedule regular "technical debt audits"

- Test knowledge transfer before it becomes critical

- Budget time for converting prototypes to production

- Make the invisible costs visible to stakeholders

How do you balance "ship fast" with "ship sustainably" while keeping your tools teachable?

## Getting Started: The Foundation

### Core Team Assembly

**Start small but think strategically**. Begin with 3-5 committed individuals who can each take ownership of key areas. Look for people with complementary skills: someone with event planning experience, a communications-savvy person, someone with industry connections, and ideally someone with non-profit or volunteer organization experience.

**Establish clear roles early**. Even before formal committees, designate who handles what to avoid overlap and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

### Legal and Organizational Structure

- Research local requirements for establishing a volunteer organization
- Consider whether you want to incorporate as a non-profit (this can wait until you're more established)
- Create basic bylaws or operating agreements early to prevent conflicts later
- Establish a simple decision-making process

<span style="color: red;"><i>BWiB BTDT advice: BWiB operated without official non-profit status for 10 years… so you don’t need to rush this.</i></span>

## Digital Infrastructure: Setting Up Your Online Presence

### Event Management Platforms

#### Luma vs. Meetup: Our Experience

- Meetup: Great for getting started, has built-in discovery features, costs ~$15-20/month
  - Pros: Established user base, good for finding your initial community
  - Cons: Limited customization, ongoing costs, platform dependency, cannot access member email addresses
- Luma: Better for established groups, more professional appearance, free tier available
  - Pros: More polished interface, better integration options, free for most events that we host so far, can access member email addresses
  - Cons: Less discovery, need to drive your own traffic

<span style="color: red;"><i>BWiB BTDT advice: BWIB started with Meetup but we have recently transitioned to Luma.</i></span>

### Communication Channels

#### LinkedIn Group

- Create a LinkedIn group early for professional networking
- Post job opportunities, industry news, and event announcements
- Encourage members to share their professional achievements
- Use LinkedIn Events to promote your gatherings
- <span style="color: red;"><i>BWiB BTDT advice: we get a lot of traffic from our LI group postings </i></span>

#### Slack Channel

- Essential for real-time communication and community building
- Create channels for: #general, #jobs, #events, #resources, #introductions
- Consider topic-specific channels as you grow (#r-users, #python, #career-advice)
- Establish community guidelines and moderation policies from day one
- <span style="color: red;"><i>BWiB BTDT advice: we have one and it’s mostly being used by the executive team, less so by the members</i></span>

#### Email List

- Don't rely solely on social platforms - build an email list
- Send monthly newsletters with event updates, job postings, and community highlights
- <span style="color: red;"><i>BWiB BTDT advice: we are still working on the best way to do this </i></span>

### Website Considerations

- Start simple: a basic website with your mission, upcoming events, and contact info
- Free options: GitHub Pages, Netlify, or basic WordPress
- Include: About page, Events calendar, Resources section, Committee information
- Make it mobile-friendly from day one
- <span style="color: red;"><i>BWiB BTDT advice: it took some effort to get the first version off the ground but we like it a lot now that it’s there! </i></span>

## Committee Structure: Learning from Boston WiB

Based on Boston WiB's successful model, consider establishing these committees as you grow:

### Essential Committees (Start Here)

1. **Advocacy Committee** - For systemic change \

   - Address equity and inclusion challenges
   - Collect and analyze diversity data
   - Advocate for policy changes in local institutions

2. **Career Sponsorship/Mentorship Committee** - Professional development \

   - Organize mentorship programs
   - Create career development workshops
   - Connect members with leadership opportunities

3. **Web/Digital Committee** - Technical infrastructure \

   - Maintain website and online resources
   - Manage digital tools and platforms
   - Curate community resources

4. **Special Programs Committee** (like Bioinformatics Sisters) \

   - Run specialized networking or mentoring programs
   - Organize niche interest groups
   - Coordinate with other chapters or organizations

<span style="color: red;"><i>BWiB BTDT advice: we didn’t have official committees for the first ~9 years of the group, but once we did establish committees, we got more things done in a more organized fashion. </i></span>

## Event Planning: What We Wish We'd Known

### Venue Selection

#### Free Options to Explore

- **Networking mixers**: Casual relationship building
- **Lunch meetups**: Getting folks together and chat over lunch
- **Journal clubs**: Discussing recent papers
- **Industry visits**: Tours of biotech companies or research facilities
- **Skill-sharing sessions**: Members teaching each other

### Speaker Recruitment

- Tap your local biotech and academic communities
- Invite recent conference speakers (they often reuse presentations)
- Consider virtual speakers to expand your options
- Create a speaker database and wishlist
- Offer to reciprocate speaking opportunities

### Timing

- During the day
  - Good for virtual events
  - Good for working parents
- Evening
  - In person events that involve networking

## Funding and Sponsorship: Making It Sustainable

### Free Resources to Maximize

Most successful chapters operate primarily on volunteer time and free resources for the first few years.

<span style="color: red;"><i>BWiB BTDT advice: 99% of our events are free to the public</i></span>

### Sponsorship Strategy

#### When to Start Seeking Sponsors:

- Once you have 50+ regular attendees
- When you have consistent programming
- After establishing credibility in the community

#### Potential Sponsors:

- Local biotech companies
- Pharmaceutical companies
- Academic institutions
- Bioinformatics software companies
- Consulting firms
- Professional service providers (legal, HR, etc.)

#### Sponsorship Packages

- Bronze ($100-500): Logo on website, mention in newsletters
- Silver ($500-1500): Event speaking slot, booth at networking events
- Gold ($1500+): Title sponsor of major events, annual report recognition

### Grant Opportunities

- Many professional organizations offer small grants for diversity initiatives
- Local community foundations
- Corporate diversity and inclusion grants
- University community engagement funds

<span style="color: red;"><i>BWiB BTDT advice: engaging with sponsors in a meaningful way takes quite a bit of time so we have one person who is working only on that.</i></span>

## Community Building: The Soft Skills

### Creating Inclusive Spaces

- Establish and enforce a code of conduct (see ours below)
- Use inclusive language in all communications
- Provide multiple ways for people to engage (in-person, virtual, async)
- Actively welcome newcomers and explain "inside" references
- Consider childcare or timing for working parents

### Sustaining Volunteer Energy

- Rotate leadership responsibilities to prevent burnout
- Celebrate volunteers publicly and often
- Set realistic expectations and timelines
- Create clear handoff procedures for roles
- Host volunteer appreciation events

### Measuring Success

Track metrics that matter:

- Attendance at events (both unique and repeat attendees)
- Engagement on digital platforms
- Career advancements of members
- Feedback scores from events
- Diversity of speakers and attendees

<span style="color: red;"><i>BWiB BTDT advice: this is also very important for engaging with future sponsors.</i></span>

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Overcommitting Early

**The Problem**: Trying to do too much too fast leads to burnout and poor quality events.

**The Solution**: Start with monthly or bi-monthly events and grow from there.

### Founder Dependence

**The Problem**: One person becomes indispensable, creating fragility.

**The Solution**: Distribute responsibilities and document processes from day one.

### Mission Drift

**The Problem**: Losing focus on your core purpose as you grow.

**The Solution**: Regularly revisit your mission statement and evaluate activities against it.

### Geographic Challenges

**The Problem**: Serving a spread-out community effectively.

**The Solution**: Embrace hybrid events and consider multiple smaller meetups.

## Final Words of Encouragement

Starting a Women in Bioinformatics chapter is incredibly rewarding but takes patience and persistence. Your first event might have 5 people - that's perfectly normal! Focus on providing value to your community, stay consistent with your programming, and be responsive to member needs.

Remember: every successful chapter started exactly where you are now. The bioinformatics community is generally supportive and collaborative, so don't hesitate to reach out to established chapters for advice, speaker recommendations, or partnership opportunities.

The field needs more diverse voices and inclusive spaces. By starting a local chapter, you're not just building a community - you're actively changing the landscape of bioinformatics for the better.

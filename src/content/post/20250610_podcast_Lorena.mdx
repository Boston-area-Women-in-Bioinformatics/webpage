Lorena Pantano and Alexandra Bartlett share the twists and turns of realizing their methylation data wasn’t what it seemed. From puzzlingly low mapping rates to unexpected cloud costs caused by unoptimized compute jobs—thankfully caught just in time thanks to cost alarms—they highlight how essential clear communication and bioinformatics-aware experimental design are to any successful project.

In our new segments, **Quick Sips** and **Brewing Up for Answers**, we talk about [PIXI](https://pixi.sh/latest/) for managing software environments (Thanks to Edmund Miller) and dig into the ever-present challenge of staying organized across complex projects.

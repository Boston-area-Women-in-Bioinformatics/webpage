Women in Bioinformatics chairs Lorena and Lina introduce their new video series tackling the career challenges that keep bioinformatics professionals up at night. With over 40 years of combined experience at Harvard, eGenesis, Ginkgo Bioworks, and other leading organizations, they're sharing the honest conversations about workplace dynamics, negotiation, and career navigation that they wish they'd had access to earlier in their careers.

Should you stay at your current job or make a move? How do you handle a colleague taking credit for your work? When should you speak up, and when should you let it go? Each video in the series addresses a specific challenge with practical, actionable advice from leaders who've been there.

This isn't about motivational platitudes—it's real talk about career strategy, advocating for yourself, supporting other minorities in the workplace, and managing the daily realities of working in science.

'Tis the season for failed pipelines, missing samples, and Slack messages at 9 PM. 🎄

If you've ever been the computational team at a scaling biotech company, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Here's my holiday gift to everyone who's debugged a pipeline on Christmas Eve:

## 🧬 The Twelve Days of Scale-Up

On the first day of scale-up, the wet lab gave to me:  
**A pipeline running on Batch**

On the second day of scale-up, the wet lab gave to me:  
Two FASTQ files  
And a pipeline running on Batch

On the third day of scale-up, the wet lab gave to me:  
Three QC checks  
Two FASTQ files  
And a pipeline running on Batch

On the fourth day of scale-up, the wet lab gave to me:  
Four missing samples  
Three QC checks  
Two FASTQ files  
And a pipeline running on Batch

On the fifth day of scale-up, the wet lab gave to me:  
**FIVE FAILED RUNS**  
Four missing samples  
Three QC checks  
Two FASTQ files  
And a pipeline running on Batch

On the sixth day of scale-up, the wet lab gave to me:  
Six adapters trimming  
**FIVE FAILED RUNS**  
Four missing samples  
Three QC checks  
Two FASTQ files  
And a pipeline running on Batch

On the seventh day of scale-up, the wet lab gave to me:  
Seven contigs mapping  
Six adapters trimming  
**FIVE FAILED RUNS**  
Four missing samples  
Three QC checks  
Two FASTQ files  
And a pipeline running on Batch

On the eighth day of scale-up, the wet lab gave to me:  
Eight BAMs a-sorting  
Seven contigs mapping  
Six adapters trimming  
**FIVE FAILED RUNS**  
Four missing samples  
Three QC checks  
Two FASTQ files  
And a pipeline running on Batch

On the ninth day of scale-up, the wet lab gave to me:  
Nine VCFs a-calling  
Eight BAMs a-sorting  
Seven contigs mapping  
Six adapters trimming  
**FIVE FAILED RUNS**  
Four missing samples  
Three QC checks  
Two FASTQ files  
And a pipeline running on Batch

On the tenth day of scale-up, the wet lab gave to me:  
Ten Slacks a-pinging  
Nine VCFs a-calling  
Eight BAMs a-sorting  
Seven contigs mapping  
Six adapters trimming  
**FIVE FAILED RUNS**  
Four missing samples  
Three QC checks  
Two FASTQ files  
And a pipeline running on Batch

On the eleventh day of scale-up, the wet lab gave to me:  
Eleven p-vals adjusting  
Ten Slacks a-pinging  
Nine VCFs a-calling  
Eight BAMs a-sorting  
Seven contigs mapping  
Six adapters trimming  
**FIVE FAILED RUNS**  
Four missing samples  
Three QC checks  
Two FASTQ files  
And a pipeline running on Batch

On the twelfth day of scale-up, the wet lab gave to me:  
Twelve figures plotting  
Eleven p-vals adjusting  
Ten Slacks a-pinging  
Nine VCFs a-calling  
Eight BAMs a-sorting  
Seven contigs mapping  
Six adapters trimming  
**FIVE FAILED RUNS**  
Four missing samples  
Three QC checks  
Two FASTQ files  
And a pipeline running on Batch

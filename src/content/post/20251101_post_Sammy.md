My experience navigating the job market has been a rollercoaster of hope and excitement to frustration and uncertainty. After months of applications, interviews, and silence, I realized I was facing more than just a challenging job market, I was at war against uncertainty. Like any data scientist should when faced with ambiguity, I set out to collect and analyze data. I created a comprehensive survey for both sides of the hiring equation, those hiring and those seeking. I set up lofty goals to understand the current state of the job market in bioinformatics and the fields which intersect it (eg. data science, biotech), uncover the challenges faced by job seekers and employers alike, and identify strategies for success in this competitive landscape. I shared the survey on linked in and asked my network to share it further. Although the response count was modest, participant answers were rich in detail and insight.

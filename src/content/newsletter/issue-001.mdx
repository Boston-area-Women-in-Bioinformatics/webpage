## Message from the Founder

![Lorena Pantano](/team/lpantano.jpg)

Ten years ago, I was sitting in a room full of bioinformaticians and realized I was the only woman there. That moment stayed with meâ€”and soon after, with a few colleagues around a table at MIT, we started a simple Meetup page. What began as small, informal gatherings has grown into an energizing community of women, organizing seminars, networking events, and fireside chats. Over the years, different leaders have kept the group alive, and more recently, we became an official non-profit with dedicated volunteers shaping the future. But at the heart of it, this group has always been about community, support, opportunity, and visibility. From just a few women at the beginning, weâ€™ve grown into a vibrant community of hundredsâ€”a powerful sign of how much this space was needed. As we celebrate our 10th anniversary, I hope this community continues to help women grow their careers, find support, and feel seen. And I invite many of you to step into the organization, because this group has never been about a few of usâ€”it has always been about all of us.

## Welcome Note from the Founder

Ten years ago, I was sitting in a room full of bioinformaticians and realized I was the only woman there. That moment stayed with me‚Äîand soon after, with a few colleagues around a table at MIT, we started a simple Meetup page. What began as small, informal gatherings has grown into an energizing community of women, organizing seminars, networking events, and fireside chats. Over the years, different leaders have kept the group alive, and more recently, we became an official non-profit with dedicated volunteers shaping the future. But at the heart of it, this group has always been about community, support, opportunity, and visibility. From just a few women at the beginning, we‚Äôve grown into a vibrant community of hundreds‚Äîa powerful sign of how much this space was needed. As we celebrate our 10th anniversary, I hope this community continues to help women grow their careers, find support, and feel seen. And I invite many of you to step into the organization, because this group has never been about a few of us‚Äîit has always been about all of us.

This season, our community gathered across Greater Boston for a dynamic lineup of events celebrating connection, learning, and leadership. From casual meetups to career strategy sessions, we‚Äôve been building momentum together.

Tis the year of Byte and Bites lunch gatherings at Time Out Market, Watertown, Somerville, and CambridgeSide where we created space for spontaneous collaboration and new friendships.

At our featured event, [Jenn Felsted-Knight, PhD, ACC](https://www.felstedcoaching.com/) led a powerful session on Finding Alignment: Strategic Positioning for Career Resilience during Uncertain Times, where we explored how to decode employer needs, articulate our unique value, and turn market uncertainty into a competitive advantage.

We also hosted an Introduction to R Packages workshop, co-organized Lightning Talks with [Boston Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](https://www.meetup.com/boston-computational-biology-and-bioinformatics-meetup/), and celebrated Women‚Äôs History Month with a special panel and networking event‚Äîgenerously sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company and [Diamond Age Data Science](https://diamondage.com/).

And we brought our passion for science outreach to the public with a booth at the Cambridge Science Carnival, where we shared hands-on activities and inspired the next generation of bioinformaticians.

Thanks to everyone who joined us. We‚Äôre excited for what‚Äôs next!

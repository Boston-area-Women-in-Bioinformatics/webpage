## Events Recap

### Byte and Bite: Bioinformatics Lunch Meetup

Our November Byte and Bite made for a cozy afternoon of networking and conversation at CanalSide Food & Drink. This casual lunch meetup continued our tradition of creating unscripted spaces for professionals to connect, share experiences, and build relationships beyond the formalities of typical networking events. Thank you to everyone who joined us. We look forward to seeing you at our next meetup!

### Communicate Your Unique Value: A Masterclass for Job Seekers

[Joanna Ghayad, PharmD, PCC](https://boston-wib.org/events/event20251204) (pronounced "guy-add," as she memorably shared) created an engaging space where attendees moved beyond resume bullet points. Through interactive frameworks and a practical fill-in-the-blank template, participants reflected deeply on their accomplishments, impact, and aspirations—discovering how to articulate their authentic professional value.

### ​Building Adaptive Strategies for Career Advancement in Science

Career paths in science rarely follow straight lines, and navigating uncertainty requires both strategic thinking and adaptability. Today, Dr. Jenn Felsted-Knight from Felsted Coaching & Consulting led our community through an exploration of building resilient career strategies in an evolving scientific landscape. Attendees engaged in reflective exercises to identify their core values, strengths, and long-term goals, learning how to pivot effectively when faced with unexpected challenges or opportunities.

Start 2025 the right way: surrounded by brilliant women in bioinformatics! Join us for a casual evening to meet the community, catch up with familiar faces, and welcome new members.

If you missed our 10-year anniversary celebration, this is your chance to snag some of that exclusive swag, including our limited-edition t-shirts. We're also arranging for a photographer to capture professional headshots—perfect for updating your LinkedIn or giving your website a refresh (details on photo sessions coming soon, but if you have ideas or connections for organizing this, reach out to someone on the [event committee](/about/committees/events) on [slack](https://boston-women-bioinfo.slack.com)).

No agenda, no presentations. Only good conversation, networking, and community. Whether you're a longtime member or considering joining for the first time, this is the perfect low-key way to connect with Boston's bioinformatics women.

We're launching a year-long mentorship program specifically designed for women who are building their careers in bioinformatics—whether you're navigating your first industry role, transitioning between sectors, or positioning yourself for leadership.

This program pairs early- to mid-career professionals with senior mentors who are established leaders in academia and industry. Through regular one-on-one meetings, mentees receive personalized guidance on career strategy, leadership development, and navigating the unique challenges women face in bioinformatics.
For mentors, this is an opportunity to invest in the next generation of leaders, share hard-won insights, and strengthen our professional community.

We're building meaningful, goal-oriented connections focused on career transitions, networking, skill building, and opening doors to new opportunities. Our vision is simple: create a lasting culture where women in bioinformatics mentor one another and champion each other's success.

This program is for professionals already working in the field—not currently accepting applications from students or recent graduates.

## 📦 Resource Drop: Skills & Communities

We've expanded the Boston Women in Bioinformatics website with two new pages designed to support your professional growth and community connections:

<u>**Upskilling Resource Library**</u> – A curated collection of tools, tutorials, and platforms across bioinformatics, machine learning, coding, and professional development to help you sharpen your skills.

<u>**Partner Communities**</u> – Discover organizations and networks in bioinformatics, biotech, and data science to expand your connections locally and beyond.

**Have a resource or community to add?** We'd love your contributions! To suggest an addition, please share:

- _For Upskilling Resources_: Name, description, URL, category (bioinformatics, machine-learning, math, biology, coding, professional-development, or other), and tags (e.g., free, beginner-friendly)
- _For Partner Communities_: Name, description, website, category (bioinformatics, biotech, data-science, or other), location, whether it's female-only, Boston-based, and relevant tags

Reach out to someone on the [web-development committee](/about/committees/web-page) on [slack](https://boston-women-bioinfo.slack.com) and help us build a comprehensive resource hub for our community!

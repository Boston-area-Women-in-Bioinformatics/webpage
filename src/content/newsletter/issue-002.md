### ​​From Biotech to Business: An AMA with the Founders of Sprout Informatics

Over 80 attendees joined Boston-Area Women in Bioinformatics (BWIB), Sprout Informatics, and the Cambridge Biotech Club online for From Biotech to Business, an AMA with Sprout co-founders Liyang Diao and Michael Seiler. Moderated by Samantha Klasfeld, founder of Chrome Key Bioinformatics (launch coming soon!), the event covered startup logistics, client acquisition, rate-setting, and the leap from employee to entrepreneur. A crowd-favorite question—“Do you foresee any issues with SO many LLCs ‘sprouting’ in this job market?”—sparked laughter and insight, as participants explored what it takes to carve out a niche in biotech consulting.

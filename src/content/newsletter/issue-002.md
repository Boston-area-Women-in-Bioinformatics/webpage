### ​​From Biotech to Business: An AMA with the Founders of Sprout Informatics

Over 80 attendees joined Boston-Area Women in Bioinformatics (BWIB), [Sprout Informatics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprout-informatics/), and the [Cambridge Biotech Club](https://www.cambridgebiotechclub.com/) online for From Biotech to Business, an AMA with Sprout co-founders [Liyang Diao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liyang-diao-90933461/) and [Michael Seiler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelwseiler/). The event covered startup logistics, client acquisition, rate-setting, and the leap from employee to entrepreneur. A crowd-favorite question, “Do you foresee any issues with SO many LLCs ‘sprouting’ in this job market?” sparked laughter and insight, as participants explored what it takes to carve out a niche in biotech consulting. Special thanks to Sprout Informatics, [Samantha Klasfeld](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantha-klasfeld/) and the BWIB Events Committee and our collaborators [Jaeseok (Jay) Park](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaypark376/), [Ryan Yordanoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-yordanoff/), and [Stephan Matissek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanmatissek/) at and the Cambridge Biotech Club for helping organizing this thoughtful AMA.

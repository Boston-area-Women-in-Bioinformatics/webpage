For more information, please review [GitHub’s Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

We may also use third-party services (such as [Google Forms](https://transparency.google/intl/en_US/our-policies/product-terms/google-forms/)) that collect or process data on our behalf. These services have their own privacy policies, which govern how they handle your information.

Personally identifiable information from surveys is kept confidential unless explicitly stated otherwise at the time of collection.

## 3. Disclosure of Personal Data

## 5. Delete Your Personal Data

You have the right to delete or request that we assist in correcting inaccuracies or deleting the personal data that we have collected about you by contacting us at [Bostonwomeninbioinformatics@gmail.com](mailto:Bostonwomeninbioinformatics@gmail.com).

## 6. Data Security

The security of personal data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If we become aware that we have collected personal data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent's consent before we collect and use that information.

## 8. Third-Party Websites

Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

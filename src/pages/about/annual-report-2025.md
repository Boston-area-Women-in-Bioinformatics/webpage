## Chairs' Message

As we close 2025, we want to begin by expressing our deepest gratitude to the incredible people who make Boston Women in Bioinformatics possible. To our volunteer committee chairs who dedicated countless hours to advancing our mission, our generous sponsors who believed in our vision, and our engaged members who bring energy and expertise to everything we do—thank you. Your commitment is the foundation of our community.

This year has been remarkable for BWIB. We organized more than 20 events that brought together women across all career stages in bioinformatics, from workshops and networking sessions to technical talks. Our community is strong—over 800 followers on LinkedIn and 400 members on Slack, reflecting the expanding need for spaces where women in our field can connect and thrive. A particular highlight was celebrating our 10th anniversary with 60 attendees and three inspiring keynote speakers who generously shared their career journeys, reminding us of how far we've come and the paths still being forged.

Perhaps most significantly, BWIB officially became a nonprofit organization in 2025. This milestone provides us with the stable infrastructure needed to sustain and grow our programs, secure funding more effectively, and serve our community for years to come.

We also recognize the challenges ahead. In an era where funding for science and diversity initiatives faces increasing restrictions, opportunities are becoming scarcer. We see this reality, and we acknowledge its impact on our members. And yet the current climate makes our work more critical than ever—we will continue standing with and supporting this community through these uncertain times.

Looking forward to 2026, we remain committed to organizing meaningful events, creating welcoming spaces for connection and growth, and launching new initiatives including mentoring circles to strengthen peer support networks. We're also developing a field status survey to gather and share data about the state of women in bioinformatics, ensuring our advocacy is grounded in evidence.

Thank you for being part of this journey.

**With gratitude,**

Lorena Pantano Chair, President and Founder Boston Women in Bioinformatics

Yevgenia Khodor Chair, Vice President Boston Women in Bioinformatics

### Mission

The Advocacy Committee establishes pathways for women to ensure equitable leadership and decision-making roles by collecting, analyzing, and summarizing data on the state of gender diversity in bioinformatics and adjacent fields.

### 2025 Accomplishments

**Survey Development**

- Researched methods and created comprehensive survey to assess the current state of gender diversity in bioinformatics and computational biology
- Designed survey questions based on common LinkedIn fields after exploratory data analysis
- Tested survey with committee members and incorporated feedback
- Built upon 2017 M. I. Stefan et al. study which showed women are underrepresented in computational biology, but focused on broader field beyond academia

**Survey Distribution & Outreach**

- Promoted survey through multiple channels: BWIB social media, newsletters, event posts
- Reached out to other bioinformatics groups including BCBB for broader community engagement
- Achieved strong response during BWIB 10th year anniversary event
- Engaged well-known bioinformatics professionals to share survey on LinkedIn

**Preliminary Analysis**

- Collected responses from 194 participants (163 female, 28 male, 1 non-binary, 1 other)
- Gathered salary data from 127 participants ranging from <$80,000 to >$200,000
- Analyzed education backgrounds (bachelors, masters, doctoral, MD/PhD) across job types (academia, industry, government, big pharma, software, biotech)
- Identified leadership gap: 21% of male respondents in leadership positions vs. 14% of female respondents
- Analyzed salary patterns across education levels: 46% of masters holders, 28% of PhD holders, and 40% of bachelor's holders reporting <$80,000

### Impact

The committee successfully developed metrics to enable data-driven advocacy for gender equity in bioinformatics. The survey revealed important trends and biases in the field, particularly regarding the gender gap in leadership roles and potential salary disparities. Despite data imbalance, preliminary findings provide crucial baseline information for future advocacy efforts.

### 2026 Plans

- Create and organize advocacy events in collaboration with other BWIB committees
- Promote the survey to ensure creation of a more balanced dataset

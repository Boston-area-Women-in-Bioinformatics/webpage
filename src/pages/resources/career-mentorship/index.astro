        <div class="text-muted dark:text-slate-300 mb-6">
          <p>
            The Boston Women in Bioinformatics (BWIB) Career Mentorship Program is a new initiative designed to empower
            women in bioinformatics to advance into leadership roles across academia and industry. This year-long
            program pairs early- to mid-career professionals with senior mentors who are established leaders in the
            field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through regular one-on-one mentorship meetings, mentees will receive personalized career guidance, strategic
            advice, and advocacy from mentors who understand the challenges and opportunities within bioinformatics.
            Mentors, in turn, will have the rewarding opportunity to support rising talent, share insights, and
            strengthen the professional community of women in bioinformatics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program fosters meaningful, goal-oriented mentorship connections that focus on leadership development,
            career transitions, networking, and skill building. Our goal is to create a lasting culture of
            mentorship—where women not only mentor one another but also open doors to new opportunities.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            Applications are open through <strong>December 2025</strong> for both mentors and mentees. The program officially
            launches in
            <strong>January 2026</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The registration period for our Career Mentorship Program has officially concluded</b>. Thank you for
            your incredible support! We are inspired by the high level of interest from aspiring mentees and the deep
            commitment shown by the BioPharma leaders who have stepped forward as mentors. We are now hard at work
            finalizing our matches and will be reaching out to all participants soon with next steps. We can’t wait to
            kick off this journey and make this pilot program a landmark success for Boston Women in Bioinformatics.

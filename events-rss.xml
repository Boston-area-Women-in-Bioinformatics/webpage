&lt;p&gt;Tired of manually tracking job applications in sprawsheets? Join BWIB for an interactive conversation with [Lianna Novitz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liannanovitz/), creator of [JustAJobApp](https://www.justajob.app/) — an [open-source](https://github.com/just-a-job-app/jobseeker-analytics) app that connects to your inbox to automatically build your job search dashboard.

**​What You&apos;ll Learn**:

- ​How JustAJobApp eliminates manual data entry and keeps you organized during your job search

- ​Live demo of the app in action

- ​The story behind building an open-source solution to job search burnout

- ​Where the app is headed next (including an exciting Crowdfunding Campaign!)

- ​How it compares to other job search tools like Teal

- ​And a little bit about Lianna, who started out in neuroscience, then pivoted to software engineering, and recently navigated her own job search (complete with graphs and all! 📊)

**​Why Attend**: With 64% of job seekers experiencing burnout and applications per hire tripling since 2021, the job search process has become a full-time job itself. Discover how automation can help you focus on what matters — landing your next role — instead of managing spreadsheets.

💡 Insights on data science meets biotech business

🎁 Raffle for a Starbucks gift card (for attendees who share feedback)

**​No more spreadsheets. No more manual tracking. Just a better way to job search.**&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><category>workshop</category><category>jobsearch</category><category>productivity</category></item><item><title>Byte and Bite: Bioinformatics Lunch Meetup</title><link>https://boston-wib.org//events/event20251107</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://boston-wib.org//events/event20251107</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When:&lt;/strong&gt; Friday, November 7, 2025 at 12:00 PM&lt;/p&gt;
